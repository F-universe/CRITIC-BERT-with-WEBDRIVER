"One of recent memory’s most impressive writing and directing debuts.",

"It will be remembered as one of the great romantic dramas of the century. It is also a personal story about the experience of emigration, about lost ties and the new identity that is built. About what is left behind. The past lives.",

"Past Lives is one of those films in which nothing seems to happen, while emotionally all sorts of stuff is going on. The performances are really terrific, with Teo Yoo creating a portrait of sweet longing so heartbreaking you want to give him a hug.",

"Too often characters in movies are who they are; they don’t change. It’s a tribute to Song’s crisp and literate script that these are people alive in the moment and in the act of becoming based on where they’ve come from.",

"The memories this film presents to the viewer are stuck in the viewer's memory for days and weeks to come.",

"The realism is encouraging, astounding, and inspirational, demonstrating just how unusually entertaining a wholesome, unadorned premise about ordinary people can be.",

"A deeply emotional experience, the film looks at all the what-ifs in our past relationships and how fate plays a role in our decisions. Very well-written and acted, this is one to be savored.",

"Playwright Celine Song’s filmmaking debut was a devastating reflection on roads not taken.",

"Movies do a lot of things. They entertain, they educate, they make audiences laugh and cry and jump out of their upholstered reclining seats. And on special occasions, they linger.",

"[Past Lives has] the emotional beats and satisfactions of genre romance, but without the happy ending. And it’s glorious.",

"What a touching story. A very striking way to look at relationships and the ways that love lingers.",

"In Past Lives by playwright and director Celine Song, everything happens with an almost contemplative slowness. [Full Review in Spanish]",

"Is this a film about longing, regret, or an analysis of miscommunication? It's hard to tell as the delivery is so dry and flat.",

"Not only does Song weave together a sophisticated and bittersweet story, she also directs it like someone well beyond their filmmaking years.",

"The writing touches the heart in all the best ways, the actors are sublime, and the subtle messaging about identity is fascinating.",

"Overlooks most of the moments it needs to examine.",

"Hollywood romantic icons may be in disrepute, but Greta Lee and Teo Yoo are dull, inexpressive performers whose emotions are as flat as the untrained subjects of a documentary.",

"I was especially taken by the performance of Greta Lee and the supporting work of John Magaro.",

"With Past Lives, writer and director Song delivers a beautiful and impeccable film where everything is perfectly measured. [Full review in Spanish]",

"In Song's film, delicacy, sensitivity and empathy towards her characters reign. [Full review in Spanish]",

"Past Lives does not contribute much more to love, cinema and spirituality than what a luxurious Sunday article in an elegant magazine offers to sophistication.",

"With such a simple plot, full of silences, looks, and small gestures... in her debut, playwright Celine Song composes a story that speaks of the great evils and good of today, of identity, of frustration. [Full review in Spanish]",

"A certainly a well-acted, well directed movie that shows that Celine Song can handle emotion (even sentimentality if you prefer) quite well, in a style that could as well dictate how romantic movies proceed from now on.",

"It is subtle, not heavy-handed. It is low-key, without gigantic emotional fireworks. There is real emotion, which finally is revealed, but it is just under the surface most of the time. This is a very well-written and acted film.",

"This all sounds rather cryptic, and the film is mysterious. It is also lucid and precise, intimately devoted to its strange lyrical sorrow. It’s as if we are watching feelings in slow motion.",

"An elegant and unexpectedly mesmerizing character piece that speaks profoundly to the concept of love in the modern age while using an intelligent and ambitious, but still very relatable woman to do so.",

"Taking her time to develop characters and relationships, Song deftly brings the audience deep into the narrative until we are fully invested in the eventual outcome.",

"Ultimately, we are all living the same lives, the same experiences, the same feelings. The film exploits the fact that coincidences don't exist and expands the potential of the eternal human question, "what if?". Masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]",

"The images and the characters’ spatial relationships within them become such a part of the story that, in the final act, simple moments like an awkward silence at a bar or waiting for an Uber transmit tremendous power.",

"Subtle and understated, if occasionally mundane, romantic drama, that reflects our complicated lives in a universal story about the life choices, and sweeps you away in its final climactic moments",

"Past Lives is based above all on two long scenes in which the characters talk, and while they do so, they evoke the wounds of time's passage. [Full review in Spanish]",

"This is, possibly, the film that has shaken me the most in the last decade, and it does so not with exaggerated moments of screams and drama, but with the perfect words to rock you into its small cosmos... [Full review in Spanish]",

"Its greatness doesn't so much immediately grab you by the throat but worms its way into your affections more and more with each passing scene, building and building until it becomes impossible to deny in its note-perfect final act.",

"Past Lives is notable for what it leaves out. It is a drama of accommodation, a minimalist romance in which the spectre of a grand passion is held tantalisingly at bay.",

"A sublime, aching meditation on memory and time, practical love and idealistic romance, and all the complex contradictions that exist in between.",

"This gorgeous, life-affirming feature is one of the best I’ve seen this year.",

"Past Lives is Song’s first movie, but it feels more like her ninth — it’s wonderfully assured.",

"Prepare to be drawn into the deeply moving drama created by Song’s atmospheric world.",

"Celine Song's debut film is a powerful metaphor for the two selves that exist within immigrants.",

"Celine Song announces herself as a major voice in cinema with Past Lives, her divine and complex reflection on enduring love.",

"The acting was stellar and it's basically about three people but the story is so deep and layered. It's almost a perfect film with saying so much by saying so little.",

"I loved this movie. It is a challenging film that makes you reflect on your own personal experiences and that's a testament to how impactful the storytelling and acting is.",

"Past Lives is truly a modern romance, rich with bittersweet understanding of what it means to live in the present.",

"A peaceful and deeply moving work. [Full review in Spanish]",

"Vibrates at a very specific emotional pitch that pierced my heart all the way to its core.",

"This movie is beautifully layered...It's [the film] is so relatable to your life, no matter who you are in terms of partners and past loves...it sticks with you long after you see it. It's definitely worthy of its Best Picture nomination.",

"The questions the film raises are simply too fascinating to ignore. Its protagonists do not want to change their present, and yet, deep inside and in an increasingly less subtle way, they cannot stop asking themselves: what if…? Full review in Spanish.",

"There’s no melodrama... Instead, we watch three incredibly lived-in performances guide these characters through a thoughtful, soft-spoken script.",

"Simple and moving, [Past Lives] is a very interesting debut feature... [Full review in Spanish]",

"Past Lives tells a story and manages to transcend temporal and physical conventions, conveying the unique magic of a deep connection that defies the restrictions of conventional logic. [Full review in Spanish]",

"Celice Song reflects upon an avalanche of romantic emotions without ever falling into kitsch. [Full review in Spanish]",

"This is not a bad film, but it is an intensely and conspicuously middle class film.",

"A nostalgic tribute to those love stories that were left in the pipeline, and with more doubts than answers. [Full review in Spanish]",

"[Past Lives] asks if a more meaningful and beautiful life might be made by accepting our finitude, keeping commitments, and paring down possibilities.",

"Lilting between Korean and English, Celine Song’s debut feature Past Lives brings an understated but wholly affecting rumination on the immigrant experience.",

"By the final scene, you’ll be crying along with Nora.",

"PAST LIVES is a beautiful, deeply touching and tender film. Fantastically played and absolutely captivating visually and musically. Restrained and yet grand.",

"Past Lives is astute and sharply-observed, emotional without being sentimental. It has lived rent-free in my mind since I saw it six months ago. It’s not to be missed.",

"With all the trappings of a romantic love triangle, the narrative skews toward the less-explored drama: how do we move forward from here? With aspects to cheer for & fear for in each character, this personal production believably bleeds angst & regret...",

"One of recent memory’s most impressive writing and directing debuts.",

"It will be remembered as one of the great romantic dramas of the century. It is also a personal story about the experience of emigration, about lost ties and the new identity that is built. About what is left behind. The past lives.",

"Past Lives is one of those films in which nothing seems to happen, while emotionally all sorts of stuff is going on. The performances are really terrific, with Teo Yoo creating a portrait of sweet longing so heartbreaking you want to give him a hug.",

"Too often characters in movies are who they are; they don’t change. It’s a tribute to Song’s crisp and literate script that these are people alive in the moment and in the act of becoming based on where they’ve come from.",

"The memories this film presents to the viewer are stuck in the viewer's memory for days and weeks to come.",

"The realism is encouraging, astounding, and inspirational, demonstrating just how unusually entertaining a wholesome, unadorned premise about ordinary people can be.",

"A deeply emotional experience, the film looks at all the what-ifs in our past relationships and how fate plays a role in our decisions. Very well-written and acted, this is one to be savored.",

"…cautious, delicate and unsensational, Celine Song’s Past Lives deserves the attention that it’s getting, and it deserves yours too…the subtle mystery outlined provides an ideal focus for self-reflection…",

"Playwright Celine Song’s filmmaking debut was a devastating reflection on roads not taken.",

"Movies do a lot of things. They entertain, they educate, they make audiences laugh and cry and jump out of their upholstered reclining seats. And on special occasions, they linger.",

"[Past Lives has] the emotional beats and satisfactions of genre romance, but without the happy ending. And it’s glorious.",

"What a touching story. A very striking way to look at relationships and the ways that love lingers.",

"In Past Lives by playwright and director Celine Song, everything happens with an almost contemplative slowness. [Full Review in Spanish]",

"Is this a film about longing, regret, or an analysis of miscommunication? It's hard to tell as the delivery is so dry and flat.",

"Not only does Song weave together a sophisticated and bittersweet story, she also directs it like someone well beyond their filmmaking years.",

"The writing touches the heart in all the best ways, the actors are sublime, and the subtle messaging about identity is fascinating.",

"Overlooks most of the moments it needs to examine.",

"Hollywood romantic icons may be in disrepute, but Greta Lee and Teo Yoo are dull, inexpressive performers whose emotions are as flat as the untrained subjects of a documentary.",

"I was especially taken by the performance of Greta Lee and the supporting work of John Magaro.",

"It has the singularity of discussing lack of communication, nostalgia and past love in times of urban alienation, but the characters remain in overly sanitized situations that, little by little, dissolve the layer of intimacy. [Full review in Spanish]",

"The entire film is punctuated by memorable sequences that function as warnings, as signs or, better yet, as clocks. [Full review in Spanish]",

"With Past Lives, writer and director Song delivers a beautiful and impeccable film where everything is perfectly measured. [Full review in Spanish]",

"In Song's film, delicacy, sensitivity and empathy towards her characters reign. [Full review in Spanish]",

"Past Lives does not contribute much more to love, cinema and spirituality than what a luxurious Sunday article in an elegant magazine offers to sophistication.",

"With such a simple plot, full of silences, looks, and small gestures... in her debut, playwright Celine Song composes a story that speaks of the great evils and good of today, of identity, of frustration. [Full review in Spanish]",

"A certainly a well-acted, well directed movie that shows that Celine Song can handle emotion (even sentimentality if you prefer) quite well, in a style that could as well dictate how romantic movies proceed from now on.",

"It is subtle, not heavy-handed. It is low-key, without gigantic emotional fireworks. There is real emotion, which finally is revealed, but it is just under the surface most of the time. This is a very well-written and acted film.",

"This all sounds rather cryptic, and the film is mysterious. It is also lucid and precise, intimately devoted to its strange lyrical sorrow. It’s as if we are watching feelings in slow motion.",

"An elegant and unexpectedly mesmerizing character piece that speaks profoundly to the concept of love in the modern age while using an intelligent and ambitious, but still very relatable woman to do so.",

"Taking her time to develop characters and relationships, Song deftly brings the audience deep into the narrative until we are fully invested in the eventual outcome.",

"Ultimately, we are all living the same lives, the same experiences, the same feelings. The film exploits the fact that coincidences don't exist and expands the potential of the eternal human question, "what if?". Masterpiece. [Full review in Spanish]",

"The images and the characters’ spatial relationships within them become such a part of the story that, in the final act, simple moments like an awkward silence at a bar or waiting for an Uber transmit tremendous power.",

"Subtle and understated, if occasionally mundane, romantic drama, that reflects our complicated lives in a universal story about the life choices, and sweeps you away in its final climactic moments",

"Past Lives is based above all on two long scenes in which the characters talk, and while they do so, they evoke the wounds of time's passage. [Full review in Spanish]",

"This is, possibly, the film that has shaken me the most in the last decade, and it does so not with exaggerated moments of screams and drama, but with the perfect words to rock you into its small cosmos... [Full review in Spanish]",

"Its greatness doesn't so much immediately grab you by the throat but worms its way into your affections more and more with each passing scene, building and building until it becomes impossible to deny in its note-perfect final act.",

"Past Lives is notable for what it leaves out. It is a drama of accommodation, a minimalist romance in which the spectre of a grand passion is held tantalisingly at bay.",

"A sublime, aching meditation on memory and time, practical love and idealistic romance, and all the complex contradictions that exist in between.",

"This gorgeous, life-affirming feature is one of the best I’ve seen this year.",

"Past Lives is Song’s first movie, but it feels more like her ninth — it’s wonderfully assured.",

"Past Lives could battle Oppenheimer at the Oscars. It’s just as explosive.",

"Past Lives may be a weepie, but it’s a hyper-sophisticated one.",

"Plaudits to the principal cast, who do a miraculous job of portraying inner conflict and ecstasy with the merest tilt of a head, or subtle shift of a shoulder.",

"A quietly devastating drama, Past Lives might be one of the early contenders for next year’s Oscars, and is certainly one of the best films you’ll see all year. Watch it before the awards season chatter begins.",

"Song finds the political in the personal and avoids seeming indulgent or niche.",

"The film’s great magic is the way it captures the beauty of lonely cities with a camera that seems to caress their geography.",

"There’s a certain tragedy at the heart of this story that no amount of goodwill can soothe: sometimes you don’t get over traumas, you just learn to live with them. But Past Lives, a thoroughly grown-up film, is able to accommodate this inconvenient truth.",

"Aesthetically, too, the film is gorgeous -- like something you want to reach out and touch.",

"If you are looking for some grown up romance, don’t let Past Lives get away.",

"It’s barely believable that this is Song’s very first feature. Her film is simply sublime from start to finish.",

"It is highly recommended as a touching and always subtle film about old memories, old friendships and contemporary realities.",

"The performances are impossibly strong and awards-season ready. Anything other than a best actress Oscar nomination for Lee will be criminal.",

"It is a film that embraces blended nationalities while acknowledging the pull of one’s earliest home. One leaves aware of unavoidable open-endedness but sated by a work that has achieved all its lofty ambitions.",

"Past Lives isn’t quite the woozy, lovelorn drama that its trailers have sold... But it is an eloquent attempt to understand how our memories can end up turning other people into projection screens for our own, confused desires.",

"Past Lives is breathtaking, leaving you speechless in the most wonderful way.",

"A little movie with the biggest of hearts, Past Lives heralds the arrival of playwright turned director Céline Song as a filmmaker with the brightest of futures. It's the most charming of debuts, and if you miss it, your screen life will be the poorer.",

"There is always a forward momentum to the film even when nothing much seems to be happening. All the scenario's emotional complexity, though, is articulated by the actors’ expressions.",

"That it’s exquisitely affecting and made with great precision and care is enough for now. No need to make a song and dance about it. Indeed, as Past Lives so deftly shows, you can have an excellent drama without any of the drama.",

"I've never quite seen a love story or a friendship bond told on screen like Past Lives, I was enthralled with the film, easily one of the best of the year.",

"It’s a must-see.",

"Prepare to be drawn into the deeply moving drama created by Song’s atmospheric world.",

"Celine Song's debut film is a powerful metaphor for the two selves that exist within immigrants.",

"Celine Song announces herself as a major voice in cinema with Past Lives, her divine and complex reflection on enduring love.",

"It is a heartbreaking film that is so masterfully made and profoundly sincere that you want to stay in its world regardless of the emotional cost.",

"As the credits roll and we’re given a moment to think about the movie in retrospect, it all just… hits different. And it’s what makes “Past Lives” all the more remarkable as a movie about the bittersweet intensity of love and longing.",

"Song composes this lyrical, melancholic film with the confidence of a director at the height of their career...[finding] pathos in the potentially mundane creases of a marital bed and a poor internet connection.",

"Past Lives is a film that leaves you breathless, and your heart aching, but in a good way. There’s something deeply comforting about knowing these feelings are universal.",

"The characters are empty enough for me to imagine my own heartache in its own stead, but hazy characterisations and intriguing concepts aren’t enough to sustain a movie.",

"The concept of In-Yun promises that after 8,000 years of connecting, they can marry and be together. Nora and Hae Sun are one life closer.",

"Told with remarkable economy, and perfect performances...",

"Hae Sung in "Past Lives" barely even exists beyond his nostalgic fixation on Nora, and Nora herself is only slightly more well-defined as a character because she has two relationships and the other characters only one.",

"The writing was like poetry, I would highly recommend",

"There’s so much to dig into and relate to, regardless of your background. Past Lives is quietly devastating.",

"Celine Song’s Past Lives calls out to tired souls. It’s a beautifully made anti-fairytale movie, where the prince and the princess meet at the wrong place and time...",

"To say too much about what happens in each episode would be to spoil the joy of encountering Song’s finely worked screenplay, which lets its characters' emotions glitter in the light.",

"In this extraordinary Academy Award-nominated film “Past Lives,” the Korean concept of inyeon is used to lead viewers into believing that Nora and Hae-sung are destined to be together – if not in this lifetime, then in the future.",

"The film is more literature than cinema, elevated mumblecore for graduate writing seminars, the opposite of, for instance, Hong Sangsoo, who makes low-budget films about writers and filmmakers without worrying about prizes...",

"Never risking discomfort, Song flattens a real-life anecdote of any truly messy feelings, resulting in a tone poem quasi-romance that’s actually serene to a fault. It’s a good movie too chronically polite to achieve anything like greatness.",

"Lee concentrates and expresses Nora's state of mind through a marvelous performance in which two feelings that initially seem impossible to transmit simultaneously come together... [Full review in Spanish]",

"Past Lives is not only a breath-taking debut by Celine Song, it is a herald to an astounding voice in cinema.",

"Past Lives is naggingly unsatisfying: the characters are not fully realised, and nor is their story. The film anticipates an impact it doesn’t earn.",

"A transcendent debut for South Korean-Canadian filmmaker Celine Song, this romantic drama is a masterclass in slow, simmering storytelling. It will stay with you, maybe even into your next life.",

"Celine Song’s directorial debut is a beautiful story of friendship & contemplation about the choices we make in life. It is powerfully relatable and the film shows us that it’s okay to be sad about the road not taken without having regrets.",

"In Past Lives, director Celine Song twists the knife on the all-too-familiar romantic woes that Asian immigrants like myself endure: the slow yet gut-wrenching impact of long-distance relationships and our complex relationship with fate.",

"A tender and mesmerising romance with an absolutely sensational lead performance from Lee.",

"It is a movie that carries the weight of years upon its shoulders, of ineffable longing and the possibility of cosmic alignment, but it does so with a cinematic spring in its step.",

"The film's directness, its relative storytelling simplicity, is also its asset. Past Lives unravels at a rhythm that weaves a slow-burning spell, one that allows an audience the space to project their own experience onto the screen.",

"The masterstroke of Song’s screenplay is that, despite its emotional directness, there is still ample room to reinterpret character dynamics up to and including the devastating final moments.",

"The bittersweet reconnecting of childhood soulmates wraps an unrealised love story in unanswerable questions.",

"One of the best written screenplays for a long, long time. It has a Woody Allen feel to it that just makes it a masterpiece.",

"It’s quite the remarkable first film for Song, who brings a tender, elegant economy to her storytelling that doesn’t quite prepare you for how much it’ll wipe you out at the closing stretch. This one aches really good, folks. I can’t shake it.",

"Like few others, Past Lives shows the cultural and emotional dichotomy of those of us who have left our countries of origin and never completely detach ourselves from them, no matter how many years go by... [Full review in Spanish]",

"For this is as much a story of her [Nora] wrestling with the importance of her Korean heritage, as it is any romantic notions of fate, destiny or, as the Koreans call it, in-yun.",

"A small, sweet but ultimately soulful film, a triumph for Celine Song and a beautifully unwrapped gift for audiences.",

"… starts slow but then ramps up into an absolute stunner of a romantic drama, populated by fleshed-out and endlessly likeable characters who explore deeply relatable aspects of loves and lives that could have been.",

"Every shot is well-considered, every line of dialogue neatly parsed, each performance exquisitely choreographed to convey a thoroughly conceived idea in a naturalistic style. It’s a lovely, lovely film, and one of the year’s best.",

"A love story that will linger on your mind for a long, long to come.",

"This delicate and eloquent meditation on destiny and choice is an emotional experience, beautifully played.",

"This is the real deal. If you’ve an interest in five-star contemporary cinema, you miss this at your peril.",

"Prepare to be drawn into the deeply moving drama created by Song’s atmospheric world.",

"Celine Song's debut film is a powerful metaphor for the two selves that exist within immigrants.",
