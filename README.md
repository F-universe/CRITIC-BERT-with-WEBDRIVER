BERT Critic.AI - Enhanced with Web Scraping
Project Description
BERT Critic.AI is an application that leverages a pre-trained BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This enhanced version integrates two main scripts:

CODE.PY: A script that uses Selenium to scrape reviews directly from the Rotten Tomatoes website. The reviews are cleaned and saved to a text file.

REVIEWS.PY: A script that reads the generated text file and analyzes each review using BERT, classifying them as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.

Key Features
Web Scraping with Selenium (CODE.PY)

Accesses the Rotten Tomatoes reviews page for a specific movie.
Interacts with the "Load More" button to fetch additional reviews.
Cleans the data by removing unnecessary details like "Full Review", "Original Score", and dates.
Saves the cleaned reviews to a text file (reviews.txt), with each review enclosed in quotation marks and separated by a blank line.
Sentiment Analysis with BERT (REVIEWS.PY)

Utilizes the nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment model to analyze the sentiment of reviews.
Reads the reviews.txt file generated by CODE.PY.
Analyzes each review individually, providing real-time sentiment classification.
Displays the results directly in the terminal.
Generates a bar chart to visualize the distribution of sentiments across reviews.

How to Run the Project
Run CODE.PY to scrape reviews:

Ensure you have a compatible WebDriver file in the specified location.
Execute CODE.PY to download and save reviews to reviews.txt.
Run REVIEWS.PY to analyze sentiments:

Reads the saved reviews.
Performs sentiment analysis and displays the results.
Generates a bar chart to visualize the sentiment trends.
Output
reviews.txt file: Contains all the scraped and cleaned reviews.
Terminal: Displays the analyzed reviews with their corresponding sentiment.
Bar Chart: Provides a visual overview of the sentiment distribution.
Conclusion
This project combines web scraping with sentiment analysis using BERT, providing an automated pipeline to gather and analyze movie reviews. It is a powerful tool for quickly evaluating public sentiment toward a movie.
